### Electrical Engineer and Data Scientist

<p>

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am an electrical engineer and data scientist with an academic mathematical and computational background, looking to solve interesting, research-type problems with high social impact. My educational and research background is in electrical engineering, materials science, and computer science. I have extensive experience with signal processing and algorithm development for software and hardware. Besides academia, I was previously involved in technology transfer, authored two patents, served as a data science consultant for a commercial company, and developed production-level software for indoor localization. I am currently working as a research engineer in the Innovation department of IKNOWHOW S.A., Athens, Greece. Over there I am currently:

- Developing machine learning and computer vision applications
- The technical lead for part of our robotics and AI projects

I am currently working on the [RoboWeldAR](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDXILnzQH0797RFclKYmcVQ) project, for which I am coordinating and co-developing a [software component](https://github.com/ikh-innovation/roboweldar-rose-ap) for 3D reconstruction and detection of candidate welding seams.
  
In the meantime, you can have a look at my article on [using deep conv nets for sorting and picking nuclear waste](https://orphefs.medium.com/detecting-and-sorting-nuclear-waste-using-deep-convolutional-neural-networks-3ada9b402363), my [online algorithm for computing moving averages and standard deviations](https://github.com/orphefs/rolling_statistics/blob/master/Rolling_Mean_and_Variance_of_a_Time_Series.pdf), and some useful [coding tips and tricks](https://github.com/orphefs/notes) I picked up along the way.
