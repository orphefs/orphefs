### Electrical Engineer and Data Scientist

<p>

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a software engineer and data scientist with a background in electrical engineering, physics, and computer science. I have worked in academia and industry and I am always looking to solve interesting, research-type problems with high social and environmental impact. I have extensive experience with signal processing and algorithm development for software and hardware. Besides academia, I was previously involved in technology transfer, co-authored two patents (one on [structural health monitoring sensor](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7c/3a/5f/4f78dd9c0a3a68/WO2018060700A1.pdf), the other on [a machine learning pipeline](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/fc/1b/bf/da720bffe3d8d7/AU2019371068A1.pdf)), served as a data science consultant, and developed production-level software for indoor localization at [a localization startup](https://navenio.com/). Most recently I worked as a research engineer in the Innovation department of [iKnowHow](https://www.iknowhow.com/). Over there I was:

- Developing machine learning and computer vision applications
- The technical lead for part of our robotics and AI projects

Most recently, I worked on the [RoboWeldAR](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDXILnzQH0797RFclKYmcVQ) project, for which I coordinated and co-developed a [software component](https://github.com/ikh-innovation/roboweldar-rose-ap) for 3D reconstruction and detection of candidate welding seams. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPShBs7qK9s) you can find a dev tutorial for it.
  
In the meantime, you can have a look at my article on [using deep conv nets for sorting and picking nuclear waste](https://orphefs.medium.com/detecting-and-sorting-nuclear-waste-using-deep-convolutional-neural-networks-3ada9b402363), my [online algorithm for computing moving averages and standard deviations](https://github.com/orphefs/rolling_statistics/blob/master/Rolling_Mean_and_Variance_of_a_Time_Series.pdf), and some useful [coding tips and tricks](https://github.com/orphefs/notes) I picked up along the way.
